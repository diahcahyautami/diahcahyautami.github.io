This is Cahya's first website repository ever. What you will find here are some of my experiences and projectsâœ¨

## **About me**
I am currentyly a third-year student majoring in [Management at IPB University](https://manajemen.ipb.ac.id/). Studying abroad has been a lifelong dream of mine, as I have always been fascinated by different cultures and the opportunity to immerse myself in an international environment.

To pursue this dream, I have actively sought out various avenues to expose myself to an international setting. I applied for prestigious opportunities such as the [MEXT Scholarship](https://www.studyinjapan.go.jp/en/planning/scholarship/), [AIESEC in Indonesia](https://aiesec.or.id/), and two attempts for student exchange programs, although I unfortunately did not succeed in securing those particular opportunities. However, I am a firm believer in perseverance, and I did not let those setbacks discourage me.

Fortunately, I am currently fulfilling my dream as an exchange student through the [Hokkaido University Short-Term Exchange Program (HUSTEP)](https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/admissions/exchange-student-admissions/exchange-programs-in-english-hustep/) and supported by the [JASSO Scholarship](https://www.jasso.go.jp/en/ryugaku/scholarship_j/ukeire.html). This incredible experience has allowed me to embrace a different academic and cultural environment, further expanding my global perspective and fostering personal growth.

## **Experiences**
Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in various aspects of business administration and finance. I have also had the opportunity to apply my skills and gain practical experience in these fields through my involvement in different organizations and events.

1. **Administration**
   
   I have experience in the administration field and possess a strong understanding of Indonesian writing rules ([EYD](https://ejaan.kemdikbud.go.id/)). During my time in high school, I held the position of General Secretary in an environmental activist organization called Sispala Bhuana Yasa and served as the secretary for the Foursma 36th Annual Year Book. Upon entering university, I eagerly applied for the administration staff position in the IPB Orientation Committee ([MPKMB IPB](https://www.instagram.com/mpkmbipb/)), which is renowned as one of the largest events held at IPB University, managing over 4000 participants every year.

    In this role, I took on responsibilities such as preparing the presence platform and meticulously recording attendance for general meetings involving 251 committees and 4200+ participants. To streamline the process, I utilized Google Form and Google Sheet to efficiently manage the data. Additionally, I successfully organized and coordinated the creation of 283 mentors' and 4200+ participants' certificates, employing tools like Google Sheets and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
    
2. **Finance**

    I have had the opportunity to take on various finance-related roles during my time at the university. These roles include serving as the Finance Manager of [KMHD IPB](https://www.instagram.com/kmhdipb/?hl=en), IPB University's Hinduist Organization, as well as managing finances for The Orientation of the Department of Management at IPB University, known as [MANSION (Management Special Occasion)](https://www.instagram.com/mansion_ipb/) and the [National Trading Competition (NTC) 2022](https://www.instagram.com/management_euphoria/). Additionally, I joined the [Centre of Management](https://www.instagram.com/centreofmanagement_ipb/) at IPB University as a staff member of the Finance Directorate.

    In addition to my organizational roles, I developed a strong interest in investment and trading. To further my knowledge in this area, I actively engaged in investment seminars, pursued self-study, followed finance influencers, and began investing on my own. I also challenged myself by participating in the Mandiri Invest 2022 stock trading competition, although I did not emerge as the winner. However, as I delved deeper into this field, I discovered that my interest was not as profound as I had initially anticipated. Consequently, I started to explore other fields that would capture my enthusiasm and curiosity.

2. **Marketing**
    
    The realization mentioned on the previous point prompted me to embark on a journey of self-discovery to determine which specialty resonated with me the most. I considered my passions and strengths, seeking alignment between my personal interests and professional aspirations. This proccess led me to another interesting field that I am eagerly want to explore, which is marketing. 
    
    I recently recalled my interest in an online course I had taken earlier, the [Fundamentals of Digital Marketing by Google Garage](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage/course/digital-marketing), which provided me with eye-opening insights into the immense potential of digital marketing. This discovery motivated me to conduct further research, leading me to enroll in the one-week online course [Intro to Digital Marketing by RevoU](https://revou.co/mini-course-digital-marketing). To make the most of my free time before departing for Hokkaido, I decided to participate in a 3-month [Digital Marketing Bootcamp by MySkill](https://myskill.id/bootcamp/digital-marketing).

    In this bootcamp, I not only acquired theoretical knowledge but also had the invaluable opportunity to put it into practice through a final project. My team and I strategized and executed digital marketing initiatives for an SME over a period of two weeks. Despite the challenges we faced, I am grateful that our efforts paid off, and we were recognized as one of the [Top 6 Final Project](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/komangdiahcahyautami_final-project-report-activity-7045355355895197696-OWun?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

    Building on this experience, I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and seeking opportunities to apply digital marketing concepts through real-case projects. Currently, I am in the process of applying for the Internship program called [Magang Kampus Merdeka](https://kampusmerdeka.kemdikbud.go.id/program/magang/detail), organized by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia. This program aims to provide valuable hands-on experience and learning opportunities in digital marketing.

    By participating in this internship program, I hope to further enhance my skills, gain practical experience, and contribute to real-world digital marketing initiatives. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and remain committed to continuous learning and professional growth in the field of digital marketing.
