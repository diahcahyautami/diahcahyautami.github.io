## About me
I’m currently a third year undergraduate student majoring [Management at IPB University](https://manajemen.ipb.ac.id/). Studying abroad has become one of my dreams since I was a kid, and I am beyond grateful that in my sixth semester I have the opportunity to participate in [Hokkaido University Short-Term Exchange Program (HUSTEP)](https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/admissions/exchange-student-admissions/exchange-programs-in-english-hustep/) in the capital city of northenmost island of Japan, Sapporo. I am highly interested and seeking opportunities in digital marketing and social media.

## Journey of My Interest 
There are four main Management pillar, Production and Operation, Finance, Marketing, and HR. It's a long jorney to find which specialities interest me the most. 
1. **Finance**

    Since I experienced in finance-related roles in some organization and events, a lot of my friends, as well as myself, thought that I absolutely will specialized in finance field. This thought even strengthen while the COVID-19 pandemic outbreaked, stock investment were going viral and there are million growth in Indonesian investor during 2020. I am one of them who started to learn it and become new investor. As I enter my second year, I decided to participated in the Finance Directorate of [Centre of Management](https://www.instagram.com/centreofmanagement_ipb/) with the hope that I can deepen my understanding in this field through the exposure that I would get by manage finance-related activities and event. I also encourage myself to participated in one of stock trading competion  called Mandiri Invest 2022. Long story short, I didn't find myself interested more in this field and I was trying to figure out which specialities that suit me the most. 
2. **Marketing**

    By the end of 2022, I remembered that I had interested in on of online course that I took earlier, [Fundamentals of Digital Marketing by Google Garage](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage/course/digital-marketing). Thus, I started to dig more about it on the internet so it led me to join a one week online course [Intro to Digital Marketing by RevoU](https://revou.co/mini-course-digital-marketing). To fill my idle time before my departure to Hokkaido I decided to participated in  3 months [Digital Marketing Bootcamp by MySkill](https://myskill.id/bootcamp/digital-marketing). Not only learn the theory, I along with my team had the opportunity to put it into practice through the final project by strategy planning and took over SME's digital marketing for 2 weeks. Thank God, despite of all of the struggles,  our team made it into the [Top 6 Final Project](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/komangdiahcahyautami_final-project-report-activity-7045355355895197696-OWun?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). Now I am eager to know more and seek the opportunities to learn digital marketing through real case project, so I am now on my process to apply in the Internship program held by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia called [Magang Kampus Merdeka](https://kampusmerdeka.kemdikbud.go.id/program/magang/detail).
